## Summary
**Current Status:** 🟢 On Track / 🟡 Minor Obstacles / 🔴 Blocked  

🟢 **On Track**: Successfully reproduced SecVerifier results across multiple environments and fixed major integration bugs between the Builder and Exploiter agents.

🟡 **Minor Obstacles**: Currently investigating degraded GPT-5 performance and BuilderAgent failures in the Claude Code integration.    

🔴 **Blocked**: Limited local computational resources significantly slow down large-scale iterations; need higher-spec lab hardware to proceed efficiently.

## Key Accomplishments This Week
### Fixed Bugs in SecVerifier
- Fixed bugs regarding environmental variables in the SecVerifier and succeeded reproducing the results for single instance_id. 
- Debugged the SecBench's integration with the SecVerifier, and fixed the builder agent failures.
- Debugged the pipeline between builder agent and exploiter agent, and fixed the exploiter agent failures.
### Reproduced SecVerifier Results 
* Successfuly reproduced in two separate testing environments: Docker-in-Docker setup and Local machine (MacOS) setup.
- Reproduced more than 50 CVE instances using GPT-4o and verified the results with the paper data.
### Advanced Model Integration (WIP)
- Experimented with GPT-5's performances, and observed degraded performance compared to GPT-4o.
	- Currently exploring the reason why GPT-5 performed even worse than GPT-4o, particularly at the Builder Agent stage.
- Integrated Claude Code with Openhands using Claude Code Agent SDK. 
	- BuilderAgent fails to build in this setting. Investigating the reason why BuilderAgent is failing.

## Blockers / Challenges
* No need for GPU right now.
* Limitation of our computational resources.
	* To generate successful metric, 898 vulnerability instances should be iterated over.
	* Concurrency option is available, however turning it on consumes more than 80% of RAM and CPU resource on our local machine.
	* Sequential run consumes too much time. (~3 min for each instance)
* If Lab computer has good hardware specs, that would be sufficient for now.

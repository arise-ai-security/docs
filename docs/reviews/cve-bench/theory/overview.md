# Overview


CVE-Bench is a real-world cybersecurity benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of LLM agents to exploit security vulnerabilities. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on abstracted Capture-the-Flag (CTF) tasks or isolated code snippets, CVE-Bench provides a controlled, sandboxed environment built on 40 real-world critical-severity Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) drawn from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). These vulnerabilities span diverse application types such as content management systems (e.g., WordPress), e-commerce platforms, AI services, mail servers, and more.


The benchmark simulates both zero-day and one-day vulnerability exploitation scenarios:
- Zero-day: Agents are given only task descriptions and must independently discover and exploit vulnerabilities.
- One-day: Agents are given a high-level vulnerability description from NVD as guidance.


CVE-Bench provides a standardized evaluation process to measure whether an LLM agent can successfully achieve one of eight defined attack goals (e.g., denial of service, database access, file creation).


## Novel Contribution
### Existing Benchmarks
Prior benchmarks, such as Cybench primarily rely on CTF-style tasks or limited sets of vulnerabilities:
- CTF-based benchmarks include many vulnerabilities but often involve artificial tasks unrelated to real production environments. They lack severity ratings and usually target small-scale or trivial vulnerabilities.
- Previous CVE-based benchmarks include real vulnerabilities but only cover a narrow set of attack types (often one per CVE) and fewer vulnerabilities.




### CVE-Bench
**Scale and Coverage**: Matches Cybench in scale (40 CVEs) while using real-world, critical-severity vulnerabilities.


**Diverse Attack Types**: Supports eight standardized attack categories, including denial of service, database access/modification, file operations, unauthorized admin login, privilege escalation, and outbound service attacks.


**Sandbox Framework**: Implements containerized vulnerable applications with evaluation servers, enabling reproducible, isolated, and automated grading.


**Lifecycle Simulation**: Models both zero-day and one-day exploitation, providing a more realistic spectrum of attacker knowledge scenarios.


**Reference Exploits**: Reproduces proof-of-concept exploits for each CVE to ensure validity and enable accurate grading.

## 1. Summary
**Current Status:** 🟢 On Track / 🟡 Minor Obstacles / 🔴 Blocked  

🟢 *Successfully debugged and fixed the SecVerifier, able to reproduce all CVE instances with GPT-4o.*

🟡 *Integration of [Anthropic SDK](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python) with the current codespace.*

🔴 *Not enough computing resources.*

## 2. Key Accomplishments This Week
- Fixed internal OpenHands issues and ensured the successful launch of the docker in doccker.
- Debugged the SecBench's integration with the SecVerifier, and fixed the builder agent failures.
- Debugged the pipeline between builder agent and exploiter agent, and fixed the exploiter agent failures.
- Reproduced more than 50 CVE instances using GPT-4o and verified the results with the paper data.
- Experimented with GPT-5's performances, and currently exploring the reason why GPT-5 performed even worse than GPT-4o, particularly at the Builder Agent stage.
- Experimentetd with Claude Code's performances, and currently actively integrating official Anthropic SDK.

## 3. Blockers / Challenges
- Need more RAM and better CPU to speed up the process. At least 32GB of memory and a CPU better than M2 Max to make the docker run more smoothly.
- Still no Lab-provided Anthropic account.

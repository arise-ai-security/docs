## 1. Summary
**Current Status:** ðŸŸ¢ On Track / ðŸŸ¡ Minor Obstacles / ðŸ”´ Blocked  

ðŸŸ¢ *Still trying to reproduce the SEC-Bench.*

ðŸŸ¡ **

ðŸ”´ *We are having disk issues: out of disk quota, slow speed. The Docker images take too much
space and loading the vulnerabilities dataset from google OSS-FUZZ takes more than 5 hrs.*

## 2. Key Accomplishments This Week
- We overcame docker image tag bugs, and dataset filtering issues.

## 7. Action Items
- [Reproduce Sec-Bench] [Action Item] â€” **Owner:** [All], **Due:** 2025-10-31
  Try the Claude code and compare it with SWE-Agent, OpenHands, Aider, etc. We want to create
  a fix rate distribution of CWE based on the types of vulnerability. Visualize the result. Demonstrate the inference examples similar to cybergym/experiments/cybench.

- [] [Action Item] â€” **Owner:** [All], **Due:** 2025-10-31
  ** Draft a document detailing issues encountered.

- [] [Action Item] â€” **Owner:** [All], **Due:** 2025-10-31
  ** Determine the most cost-effective platform. Calculate expected costs based on weekly working hours.

## 8. Progress over the last week to set up SEC-bench
- [Implementation Overview](https://arise-ai-security.github.io/docs/reviews/sec-bench/implementation/overview)
- Currently loading a subset of 224 instances out of 738.
- Goal: Reproduce SEC-bench results with Claude Code.

## 9. Possible Solutions
1. Configure machines in the lab with around 1 terabyte of storage and test feasibility on one machine.
2. Use vast.ai to rent GPUs at an affordable rate.

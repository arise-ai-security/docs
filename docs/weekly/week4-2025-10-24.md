## 1. Summary
**Current Status:** 🟢 On Track / 🟡 Minor Obstacles / 🔴 Blocked  

🟢 *Still trying to reproduce SEC-Bench.*

🟡 **

🔴 *We are having *

## 2. Key Accomplishments This Week
- Downloaded the vulnerabilities dataset from OSS-Fuzz
- Pivoted to reproducing SEC-Bench entirely on our local machines, rather than in the lab server
- Moved on from downloading vulnerability instances to getting SecVerifier set up
  - SecVerifier would allow us to run the agents
---

## Blockers / Challenges
- Trying to run ./run_multi-agent.sh -m 10 -i gpac.cve-2023-5586 -b cve
- Currently failing
- We first tried to get this running locally, following instructions in Development.md, but this resulted in many errors
- We pivoted to setting up the docker container, following the very last section of instructions in Development.md. This seemed to be more promising. Even though we ran into many errors, they were more easily fixable. However, we all reached the blocker error 
  “unable to start container process: error during container init: exec: "/openhands/micromamba/bin/micromamba": stat /openhands/micromamba/bin/micromamba: no such file or directory: unknown”
- We then noticed that a subsequent readme file specifically in the dev directory included a message at top of the page, warning that this docker-within-a-docker environment is not supported and might not work.
- We decided to switch back to trying to get the multi-agent command to run locally, where we are still getting the same error message with micromamba.

## Possible Solutions
1. Configure machines in the lab with around 1 terabyte of storage and test feasibility on one machine.
2. Use vast.ai to rent GPUs at an affordable rate.
